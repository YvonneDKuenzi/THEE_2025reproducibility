This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

# Annotateee title

## Anotatee subtitle

### Anotatee subsubtitle

```{r}
# Annotateee!
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# function to multiply integers from 1 to 10 by a parameter value
get.multiples1to10 <- function(multiplier){
   numbers <- 1:10
   return(multiplier * numbers)
}

# display results for parameter value set to 3
value <- 3
results <- get.multiples1to10(multiplier = value)

# print results to console
print(results)


# saving output 
write.csv(results, file = "myResults.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# create filename for results indicating the parameter value that was used
the_filename <- paste("multiples1to10--multiplier", current_value,".csv")
print(the_filename)

# saving output with created filename
write.csv(results, file = the_filename, row.names = FALSE)

for(current_value in 2:4){
  results <- get.multiples1to10(current_value)
  the_filename <- paste("multiples1to10-multiplier", current_value,".csv")
  write.csv(results, file = the_filename, row.names = FALSE)
}

```
